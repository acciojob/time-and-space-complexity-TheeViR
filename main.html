	<h1>Understanding about Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity measures how the runtime of an
		algorithm changes with input size. It helps us
		determine how efficient an algorithm is under
		different conditions.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of
		memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows.
		For example, storing an array of size n has a space
		complexity of O(n).
